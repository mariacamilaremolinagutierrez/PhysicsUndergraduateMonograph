\section{Importance of this result}

No one has tried this combination of rotation and outflows velocity before. These combinations of values make a lot more sense, recalling that \vout is caused mainly by ejection of material out the galaxy. It is then common and normal that a galaxy rotates faster than it expands, not the opposite. \\

Many authors that only include the outflows effect are able to fit observational spectra but with a very large magnitude of \vout. And others that include the rotational effect are able to obtain the two peaks but not their asymmetry. The new model proposed in this monograph can cause both of these effects with typical LAE's values.\\
